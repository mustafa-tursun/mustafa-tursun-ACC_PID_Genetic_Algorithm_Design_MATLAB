# mustafa-tursun-ACC_PID_Genetic_Algorithm_Design_MATLAB

This project is our graduation thesis. 

Firstly you should read Thesis from "Thesis and Poster " document.

Then you can see and run simulink from main doc which its name is "ACC_Control_Vehicle_tf.slx". 
here inthe  slx file here, the Adaptive navigation system with Simulink and the vehicle system used can be examined. 
In fact, only the nonlinear transfer function is seen here.
Matworks' own published vehicle blocks and the actual simulation can be examined in the "PTB_ConventionalModel.slx" file.

For an another application of PID_ACC as in my thesis u can find Genetic Algorithm. To easy undertand u should watch below link
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5C_z1nVaSg&t=474s.

Then u can find Genetic Algorithm tuned PID codes in "plots_GA.m" for plotting and run every function scripts.

All of these codes prepared with 2024a Matlab.
Maybe for the run main blocks of the vehicle you need to update your matlab because of updated libraries.

Thx my mate for his contribution.
